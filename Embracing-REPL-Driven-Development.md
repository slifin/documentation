# Embracing REPL-Driven Development 

## IntelliJ, Cursive, and Comment Blocks

## Introduction

One of the true joys of working with Clojure is the immediacy of seeing your code come to life through the Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL). It's like having a conversation with your code, a dialogue that fosters a deeper understanding of both the problem you're trying to solve and the Clojure language itself. This article will walk you through setting up an interactive Clojure environment in IntelliJ IDEA using the Cursive plugin. Specifically, we'll focus on a seamless REPL-Driven Development (RDD) workflow that relies on comment blocks within your code for testing and exploration.

## An Introduction to Comment Blocks and Their Role

If you're new to Clojure, you might wonder what comment blocks are and why they're being highlighted in this article. In Clojure, comments usually start with a semicolon (`;`) and are ignored by the compiler. However, Clojure also allows for blocks of code to be "commented out" using the `(comment ...)` form.

These comment blocks provide a sandboxed area within your code file where you can place executable code snippets, example usages, or even debugging commands. When you run your application, the code within these blocks is not executed. However, during development, you can interact with these snippets by sending them to the REPL for execution, allowing you to rapidly test and experiment without altering your main program.

## Prerequisites

- JDK installed
- IntelliJ IDEA installed
- Clojure CLI installed
- Familiarity with basic Clojure syntax

## Setting Up IntelliJ and Cursive

Before diving into the REPL and comment blocks, you'll need to have IntelliJ IDEA and the Cursive plugin installed. Here's a quick guide:

### Installing IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Download**: Visit the [IntelliJ IDEA download page](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) to download the version of IntelliJ that suits your operating system.
2. **Install**: Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install IntelliJ IDEA on your machine.

### Installing the Cursive Plugin

1. **Open IntelliJ IDEA**: Once installed, launch IntelliJ IDEA.
2. **Go to Plugins**: Navigate to `File > Settings > Plugins`.
3. **Search and Install**: In the search bar, type "Cursive" and install the plugin that appears.
4. **Restart IntelliJ**: After the installation is complete, you'll be prompted to restart IntelliJ IDEA. Make sure to do so to activate the Cursive plugin.

Now that you have IntelliJ IDEA and Cursive installed, you're ready to start your Clojure development journey with a focus on a smooth REPL-Driven Development workflow.

## Keyboard Shortcuts for Rapid Iteration

1. **Navigate to Keymap**: Go to `File > Settings > Keymap`.
2. **Find REPL Commands**: Use the search box to look for "REPL" actions.
3. **Assign Shortcuts**: For actions like "Send form before caret to REPL," right-click and choose "Add Keyboard Shortcut" to set a convenient key combination.

## Comment Blocks and the REPL

Within your Clojure source files, include comment blocks that contain code snippets you wish to test or explore.

```clojure
(comment
  ;; This won't be executed in your application, but can be sent to the REPL
  (println "This is a test")
  
  ;; Sample function
  (defn square [x] (* x x))
  
  ;; Test the function
  (square 4)
)
```

## Utilising Comment Blocks with the REPL

1. **Place the Cursor**: Navigate to the specific form within the comment block that you want to test.
2. **Send to REPL**: Use the keyboard shortcut you set up earlier to send this form to the REPL for execution.

## A Typical Workflow

1. **Write Code**: Draft your functions, algorithms, or other Clojure code.
2. **Comment Blocks**: Inside a comment block, jot down the lines you would use to test or call these functions.
3. **Quick Execution**: Use your keyboard shortcuts to quickly send these test lines to the REPL.
4. **Refine**: Based on the REPL feedback, refine your code as needed.
5. **Keep Going**: This cycle of coding, testing, and refining is the essence of RDD.

## Advantages

- **Staying in the Editor**: Your focus stays within the editor, where the creative process is happening.
- **Instant Feedback**: Get immediate feedback from the REPL, leading to quicker iteration.
- **Documentation**: Comment blocks can serve as useful annotations and usage examples, right where you need them.

## Conclusion

This method of interactive development isn't just a "nice-to-have" but rather a core philosophy of effective Clojure programming. By integrating your IntelliJ editor with the REPL and making use of comment blocks for rapid testing, you are setting yourself up for a truly fluid and efficient development experience. Happy coding!
